# Saturn Engine

Saturn Engine is a 3D C++17 game engine written purely in DirectX 12. I'm not currently planning on supporting other platforms other than Windows, but these are only plans and I might change them later.

This engine isn't even close to being finished so I don't wanna promise anything more in here. The rest of README coming soon...
